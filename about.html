                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>
                    Throughout my time at OU, I have always made the most of the opportunities available to me. This has allowed me to excel in my coursework
                    while participating in extra-curriculars as well. I am proud to annouce that I have maintained a 3.9 GPA over my four years of school.
                    I am an active member of the Honors College at OU, as well as a Peer Trainer in the JCPenney Leadership Program. Additionally, I am
                    a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have expanded my resume with work experience during my time at OU as well. My freshman year, I was hired at Sooner Card, the
                    ID card office on campus. I have worked my way up to my current position as assistant manager at the office. Additionally, I have 
                    completed various internships, starting my sophomore year summer at Ben E. Keith Foods. Following this expereince, I decided I wanted
                    to get into consulting, so I applied and was accepted to I-CCEW, a consulting internship at OU. After completing this program, I went 
                    straight into my summer internship at Opportune, where I have accepted a full time return offer for Summer 2025. I am currently
                    working as a Team Lead for I-CCEW, as I was invited back for the fall 2024 semester. Next semester I am excited to enjoy my last semester
                    at OU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have expanded my global worldview through two OU study abroad experiences. After my freshman year, I particiapted in the Global
                    Business to Arezzo program, studying Managerial Accounting and Business Finance in Arezzo, Italy. I also went on the JCPenney study
                    abroad trip to Costa Rica and Panama during Janurary of 2024.
